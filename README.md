# Simulation of Schellingâ€™s Model of Segregation on Two Agents System

### Python simulation of Tomas Schelling's agent-based model that suggested inadvertent behaviour might also contribute to racial and economic segregation. The program enables users to modify different parameters, like factor of tolerance, and to observe state of the matrix after each step of segregation until all agents are satisfied.

#### Changeable parametars:
- Agents tolerance
- Total population size
- Population ratios
- Number of uninhabited positions

#### <i><b>Statistics.py</b></i> generates relevant plots for future analyses.
